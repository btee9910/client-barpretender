## BACKEND
- This project utilisez RAILS as the backend server. The React app hadles the frontend user interface and interactions, while Rails serves as teh backend to handle data storage, retrieval and API endpoints.
## PLANNING AND APPROACHES
- BarPredender was a group project built as Project 2 for Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly
- As a group we spent some time to plan both backend and frontend together.
this is the working tree we have worked off

## FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS
- Currently only the admin can make contributions to the app through create/edit/delete functions. In the futre this feature can be extended to the users.
- Further interactions with the user can be implemented. For example user can like/dilike cocktails or can add comments to be more interactive.
- Features like the app chooses random cocktail for the user can be implemented.
- Adding 'forget username, password' feature.
- Better styling of the app.
